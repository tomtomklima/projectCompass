SelfCalibrated_v2:

- no available library worked
- the basic idea is that I calibrated the sensor manually once (maximum values for each axis) and then use that information to normalize and center the data.
- works well (as far as I tested it). 
- If the tilt is too high, the values are ignored (criterion: z-value).
